## Getting Started

To start contributing to JS-HTTP, follow these steps:

1. Fork the JS-HTTP repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pb2204/js-http.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

4. Make your changes and commit them:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your meaningful commit message here"
   ```

5. Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

6. Create a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original JS-HTTP repository.

7. Wait for the maintainers to review your PR. Please be patient and responsive to feedback.

8. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged, and your contribution will be part of the project.

## Contributor Workflow

- Always work on a feature branch, not the `main` branch.
- Keep your forked repository up-to-date with the latest changes from the `main` branch of the original repository.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Be respectful and constructive in all communication.
